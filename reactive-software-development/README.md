# reactive-software-development

Reactive software development is becoming essential to implementing responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven solutions, yet by aligning scale and throughput with business-driven model fluency of your core initiatives, you can achieve critical differentiating competitive advantage.

Rarely achieved in past years, fully utilized hardware can now reach the performance, throughput, and scale possible with Reactive software development’s responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven solutions. As crucial, fiscally-minded technical stakeholders see the urgent need to partner with business leaders in order to create software that delivers critical, differentiating innovations that are in demand to gain and maintain leadership in today’s fast-paced commercial markets. The world of distribution, concurrency, latency, and the uncertainty of time-critical results, must be tackled along with complex business challenges. This workshop introduces Reactive architecture and programming along with the open source vlingo/platform to leverage using Domain-Driven Design with Reactive properties. Adopt this very lightweight JVM-based microservices toolkit to implement with Java and Kotlin and other modern languages to develop cloud-native services and apps on small devices such as Android mobile and IoT for business differentiation.

This two-day, intensive, and hands-on workshop first builds your foundation with the Actor Model using vlingo/actors. This workshop then expands your understanding with advanced application and system design approaches, using Domain-Driven Design and Microservices. The workshop takes you much deeper into more advanced topics of Web applications with vlingo/http, using vlingo/symbio for a range of persistence options such as object storage, CQRS, and Event Sourcing, and how to leverage vlingo/lattice over vlingo/cluster for highly available distributed systems. This is a hands-on workshop. There are many practical exercises and students are strongly encouraged to engage using the vlingo/platform components.

## Day 1: Foundational Actor Model and DDD

The first day of the workshop builds your foundation with actors using vlingo/actors. You will learn the Actor Model, DDD, and how to solve common distributed computing challenges using the vlingo/platform components' API.
