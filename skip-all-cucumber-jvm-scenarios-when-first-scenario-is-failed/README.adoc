= Skip all cucumber-jvm scenarios when first scenario is failed

== Introduction
Recently, I am joined on the ongoing project which has Maven and Cucumber based automation test suite.
The complicated things with that project are:

* The infrastructure is very unreliable which one used to run the acceptance tests.
* Everywhere waiting time placed in acceptance tests source code due to that usually tests need a long time to execute all scenarios.
* The result of these reasons is pipeline is almost red all the time.

So I was looking for a way to stop testing when the first scenario is failed.

== JUnit RunListener

One way to solve this problem is by using JUnit RunListener which calls `System.exit(-1)`
when the first test failure occurs.
The code for the RunListener looks like this:
[source,java]
----
package io.github.bhuwanupadhyay.junit;

import org.junit.runner.notification.Failure;
import org.junit.runner.notification.RunListener;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class FailFastListener extends RunListener {

    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(FailFastListener.class.getName());

    @Override
    public void testFailure(Failure failure) throws Exception {
        LOG.info("Failed: " + failure.getTrace());
        super.testFailure(failure);
        System.exit(-1);
    }

}
----
And the corresponding configuration in the pom:
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.22.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <properties>
            <property>
                <name>listener</name>
                <value>io.github.bhuwanupadhyay.junit.FailFastListener</value>
            </property>
        </properties>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

The advantage of this approach is, that you can actually configure the fail fast behavior in the external pom. So no code changes needed and flexibility added.

And the disadvantage about this solution was the call to System.exit() which immediately terminates the test run, without the test runner having a chance to output some kind of summary. That is especially bad in environments where test results are not logged verbosly.

== Run Notifier

The solution is the method `pleaseStop()` in the class `RunNotifier`.
This method signals JUnit to stop execution of any following tests.
It might be that some tests are still executed when running tests in parallel though.
In order to access this method I had to extend the solution above in the following way:

* Pass the `RunNotifier` to the RunListener and call `pleaseStop()` on the first failure:
[source,java]
----
package io.github.bhuwanupadhyay.junit;

import org.junit.runner.notification.Failure;
import org.junit.runner.notification.RunListener;
import org.junit.runner.notification.RunNotifier;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class SafeFailFastListener extends RunListener {

    private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(FailFastListener.class.getName());

    private final RunNotifier notifier;

    public SafeFailFastListener(RunNotifier notifier) {
        this.notifier = notifier;
    }

    @Override
    public void testFailure(Failure failure) throws Exception {
        LOG.info("FAILED: " + failure.getTrace());
        super.testFailure(failure);
        notifier.pleaseStop();
    }

}
----


* Implement an own TestRunner that inherits from the one regularly used in cucumber feature test
 (e.g. `Cucumber`) that has access to the `RunNotifier`:
[source,java]
----
package io.github.bhuwanupadhyay.junit;

import cucumber.api.junit.Cucumber;
import org.junit.runner.notification.RunNotifier;
import org.junit.runners.model.InitializationError;

public class FailFastCucumberRunner extends Cucumber {

    /**
     * Constructor called by JUnit.
     *
     * @param clazz the class with the @RunWith annotation.
     * @throws InitializationError if there is another problem
     */
    public FailFastCucumberRunner(Class clazz) throws InitializationError {
        super(clazz);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(RunNotifier notifier) {
        notifier.addListener(new SafeFailFastListener(notifier));
        super.run(notifier);
    }

}
----

* You need to change feature test runner using `FailFastCucumberRunner` like below:
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(FailFastCucumberRunner.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        plugin = {"pretty"},
        features = {"src/test/resources/order-service.feature"},
        glue = {"io.github.bhuwanupadhyay.ordering"})
public class OrderServiceFeatureTest {
}
----

* The corresponding configuration in the pom:
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.22.1</version>
</plugin>
----

The full source for these two approach can be found https://github.com/BhuwanUpadhyay/skip-all-cucumber-jvm-scenarios-when-first-scenario-is-failed[here]

== Conclusion
Using RunListeners can be used to abort unit testing on a failure using System.exit.
This approach has the advantage that the code does not need to be changed.
The disadvantage being that System.exit prevents any further processing of the test environment as well.

Using an own TestRunner in addition to a RunListener as described above is more elegant but
includes changes to the source code of the test classes. And you have to be polite ðŸ˜‰
